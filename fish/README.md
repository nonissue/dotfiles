# Fish Config Info

- All kinds of malarkey with updating fisher, though I agree with the direction of the changes
- Some OMF plugins aren't compatible with fisher 4.2 (plugin-expand, plugin-sudope, plugin-bang-bang)
- Only one I think I use is plugin-bang-bang, but realistically the fish docs lay out a compelling case for it being unnecessary
  - Eg. `Alt+Up` recalls arguments (https://fishshell.com/docs/current/faq.html)
    - This behaviour also can match words
